# My-Portfolio

This is a project made during my Technigo Bootcamp 2019. The purpouse was to make our own portfolio and also to start doing accessability testing to see if our code is good from a user perspective. It is a work in progress and therefore it will be updated continously with my coming projects that I have/will make.


## 1. What is this?

Briefly describe the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## 2. What did I do?

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## 3. Where can you see it in action?

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
