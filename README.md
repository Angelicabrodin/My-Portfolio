This is a project made during my Technigo Bootcamp 2019.

## 1.What is this?

 The purpouse was to make our own portfolio and also to start doing accessability testing to see if our code is good from a user perspective. It is a work in progress and therefore it will be updated continously with my coming projects that I have/will make.

 ## 2. What did I do?

During this project I have tried to set the design and layout from a user accessability perspective. I have used cross-browser testing, and W3C in order to apply the best elements from a user perspective. Since this is a work in progress it will be updated and refined continously. 


## 3. can you see it in action?

This is where to find my deployed project:
