# My-Portfolio
This is a project made during my Technigo Bootcamp. The purpouse was to make our own portfolio and also to start doing accessability testing to see if our code is good from a user perspective.
It is a work in progress and therefore it will be updated continously with my coming projects that I have/will make.
